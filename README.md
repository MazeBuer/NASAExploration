# How it's made
<h3>Tech Used:</h3> HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, NASA API

This static webiste integrates multiple NASA API's that provide photos and other information based on date chosen in the provided input. Using the fetch method, I utilized NASA's documentation and input data into JavaScript. 
Pure CSS is used for the rotation of the logos on the main page. 

# How to Navigate
On the main page directory, make a selection to explore information on astronauts, mars, space, or visit the official NASA website directly. You are able to select a date and receive the image taken from NASA that day and a small description of the photo. 

# Purpose of the Site
Educational use for kids in a class setting or personal curiosity to explore NASA's photos based on date and location. 
The Picture of the Day page includes a small description of the photo taken.
Mars Rover page includes landing date, Rover name, and if the Rover is still active. 
Link to the offical NASA webiste is located within the NASA logo to get more information and look deeper into the NASA recourses available. 

# Optimization
Add mobile and responsive functionality throughout the multiple pages of the site. 

# Lessons Learned
The importance of great documentation and being able to read the API documents allowed for easy integration of multiple API's.
